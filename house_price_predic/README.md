Running the Project

Data Preprocessing
python src/preprocess.py

Train Linear Regression Model
python src/train.py

Train Ridge Regression Model
python src/train_ridge.py

Predict House Price
python src/predict.py

## Usage Example

Input:

Median Income: 5

House Age: 25

Average Rooms: 6

Average Bedrooms: 1

Population: 1000

Average Occupancy: 3

Latitude: 37

Longitude: -122

Output:

Predicted House Price:
$2.87 (hundreds of thousands of dollars)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following visualizations were performed:

1. House Price Distribution
2. Correlation Heatmap
3. Median Income vs House Price
4. Average Rooms vs House Price

Key Findings:

* Median Income has the strongest positive correlation with house price.
* Most house prices are concentrated between 1 and 3.
* Average rooms show a weaker relationship with house prices.

## Model Performance

| Model             | MAE    | RMSE   | R²     |
| ----------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Linear Regression | 0.5332 | 0.7456 | 0.5758 |
| Ridge Regression  | 0.5332 | 0.7456 | 0.5758 |

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-Learn
* Joblib

---

## Known Limitations

* Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship between features and target.
* Model performance can be improved using advanced algorithms such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
* No web-based user interface has been implemented.
